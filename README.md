# Automatic Item Categorization Model with BERT

## Overview
This project aims to automatically categorize items added to a kitchen into multiple categories using a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model implemented with PyTorch. The provided sample data is used to train the model, which includes items, ingredients, and various classifiers such as sweet, sour, spicy, main course, dessert, starters, etc. Additionally, a website is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, connected with Python, allowing cooks to add new dishes to the menu, which are automatically categorized based on the classifiers.

## Features
**BERT Model**: Utilizes a BERT model for natural language understanding and multi-label classification.

**PyTorch Implementation**: The model is implemented using PyTorch, a deep learning framework.

**Custom Dataset**: The dataset includes items, ingredients, and multiple classifiers to train the model effectively.

**Website Integration**: A website interface is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing cooks to add new dishes with automatic categorization.

**GitHub Repository**: The project is hosted on GitHub for easy access, collaboration, and further development.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automatic-item-categorization.git
   2. Install the required dependencies:
      pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## Usage
1. Train the BERT model using the provided dataset.
2. Host the website locally or deploy it on a web server.
3. Access the website and start adding new dishes to automatically categorize them.

## Dataset
The dataset should include items, ingredients, and multiple classifiers such as sweet, sour, spicy, main course, dessert, starters, etc. Ensure that the dataset is properly formatted and labeled for effective training.
